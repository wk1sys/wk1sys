# I spend more time editing readme.md than I do actually developing my projects.
I'm an aspiring developer.

## My Work:
I have quite a bit of experience with Python (Of which I still suck at coding in Python) and happen to also do Graphic Design of which I think is improving quite well, specifically, I already have made some assets for `BTT and void{null}` which I think are relatively good but not quite what my *best* work.
### BTT
BetterTimetable has a weird history, it's been an evolving project that has been reworked, deleted, meme'd and remade. And now I've pulled the reset switch, and well, it's now back, kind of, still not done with the inital build even but it's still *there*
