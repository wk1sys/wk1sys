# I spend more time editing readme.md than I do actually developing my projects.
Welcome! I'm an aspiring developer that works on projects like `BTT`, of which, you might see that project is kind of... dead, at the moment, but I'll work on it *eventually*.
## My Work:
I have quite a bit of experience with Python (Of which I still suck at coding in Python) and happen to also do Graphic Design of which I think is improving quite well, specifically, I already have made some assets for `BTT and void{null}` which I think are relatively good but not quite what my *best* work.
### BTT
BetterTimetable has a weird history, it's been an evolving project that has been reworked, deleted, meme'd and remade. And now I've pulled the reset switch, and well, it's now back, kind of, still not done with the inital build even but it's still *there*

### void{null}
Not really directly development related, but I've made a podcast with a friend of mine, that being void{null} and of which I've produced some art assets for. I also host the podcast and write the script for it.

## My Hobbies:
I am also an esports fanatic and an aspiring ADC, I kind of founded my own esports organization that isn't even completely ready yet but it's something I'm currently doing. Also possibly sim-racing enjoyer but I'm collecting the kit for it.
